# About me
As a Demographer, I was trained at the Institute of Demographic Training and Research (IFORD) where I graduated with a Masters in Demography. I am particularly interested in child health and child education.
I am currently pursuing PhD research at IFORD under the theme: Gender-sensitive incidence of orphanage on child education in Senegal.
